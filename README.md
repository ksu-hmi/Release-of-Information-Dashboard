# Project Description
This is a Streamlit web application for healthcare professionals to track their release of information productivity. It allows users to enter data such as calls, voicemails retrieved, total phone time, type of request, number of requests completed, pages sent, time spent, radiology CDs created, images clouded, and non-productive time. The application then saves the data to a CSV file for later analysis. The application also features mandatory fields and error messages for when users forget to fill in required information.

The second page is a dashboard that displays live data for further analysis. This is a work in progress.
